# EveryAction-Exercise
 My response to EveryAction's take-home coding exercise.

# Requirements
  - python3 to run the script
  - the packages listed in requirements.txt
  - a .env file with the variable "MIKES_API_KEY", set to your NGP 7 API key

# Example
This assumes you have already installed python3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mike-J-W/EveryAction-Exercise.git

cd EveryAction-Exercise

echo "<your api key>" > .env

python3 pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 create_email_report.py
```
